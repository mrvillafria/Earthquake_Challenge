# Mapping Earthquakes with JS and APIs

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will be using JavaScript, D3 library, Leaflet.js, Mapbox API, and HTML. We will be retrieving our data from a GeoJSON file which is a type of JSON file specific for hosting geographical information. 


### Purpose
The purpose of this week's project is to populate a geographical map with earthquake data for the Disaster Reporting Network. This interactive visualization displays earthquakes from around the world. Each earthquake will be represented by a circle and color and that shows the magnitude and location. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger in size and darker in color.
